 * This algorithm performs *depth-first* *tree traversal* in *preorder*
 * (**NLR**) or if `reverse` is given, in *reverse preorder* (**NRL**).
 *
 * You can choose for which nodes `visitor` is called by passing a `test`.
 * For complex tests, you should test yourself in `visitor`, as it will be
 * faster and will have improved type information.
 *
 * Walking the tree is an intensive task.
 * Make use of the return values of the visitor when possible.
 * Instead of walking a tree multiple times, walk it once, use `unist-util-is`
 * to check if a node matches, and then perform different operations.
 *
 * You can change the tree.
 * See `Visitor` for more info.
 *
 * @param tree
 *   Tree to traverse.
 * @param test
 *   `unist-util-is`-compatible test
 * @param visitor
 *   Handle each node.
 * @param reverse
 *   Traverse in reverse preorder (NRL) instead of the default preorder (NLR).
 * @returns
 *   Nothing.
