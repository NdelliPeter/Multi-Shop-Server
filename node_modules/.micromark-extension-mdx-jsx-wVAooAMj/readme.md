## What is this?

This package contains an extension that adds support for the JSX syntax enabled
by [MDX][mdxjs] to [`micromark`][micromark].
These extensions are used inside MDX.
It mostly matches how JSX works in most places that support it (TypeScript,
Babel, esbuild, SWC, etc).

This package can be made aware or unaware of JavaScript syntax.
When unaware, expressions could include Rust or variables or whatnot.

## When to use this

This project is useful when you want to support JSX in markdown.

You can use this extension when you are working with [`micromark`][micromark].
To support all MDX features, use
[`micromark-extension-mdxjs`][micromark-extension-mdxjs] instead.

When you need a syntax tree, combine this package with
[`mdast-util-mdx-jsx`][mdast-util-mdx-jsx].

All these packages are used in [`remark-mdx`][remark-mdx], which focusses on
making it easier to transform content by abstracting these internals away.

When you are using [`mdx-js/mdx`][mdxjs], all of this is already included.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-extension-mdx-jsx
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {mdxJsx} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-extension-mdx-jsx@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {mdxJsx} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-extension-mdx-jsx@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'
import {mdxJsx} from 'micromark-extension-mdx-jsx'

const output = micromark('a <b c d="e" /> f', {extensions: [mdxJsx()]})

console.log(output)
```

Yields:

```html
<p>a  f</p>
```

â€¦which is useless: go to a syntax tree with
[`mdast-util-from-markdown`][mdast-util-from-markdown] and
[`mdast-util-mdx-jsx`][mdast-util-mdx-jsx]
